## [2026-06-18] WhisperX forced alignment instead of re-running Whisper

**Context:** `shorts_generator.py` was running Whisper a second time on the audio segment for word timestamps, independently of the first SRT-generating run.

**Options:**
- A) Save `_words.json` on the first Whisper run (simple, but text may contain transcription errors)
- B) WhisperX forced alignment on corrected SRT (correct text, separate run)

**Decision:** B — WhisperX forced alignment.

**Rationale:** The corrected SRT is the single source of truth. WhisperX aligns the correct text to audio precisely, eliminating transcription errors from karaoke highlights. One place to fix mistakes.

## [2026-06-18] OpenCV Haar cascades instead of MediaPipe for face detection

**Context:** MediaPipe 0.10 removed the `mp.solutions` API. Required a model download and new API.

**Options:**
- A) Downgrade MediaPipe to 0.9.x
- B) MediaPipe Tasks API (new) + model download
- C) OpenCV Haar cascades (built-in, no extra dependencies)

**Decision:** C — OpenCV Haar cascades.

**Rationale:** Zero overhead, already installed. Since we use one static offset per segment (not dynamic tracking), a more sophisticated model's accuracy gain doesn't justify the added complexity.

## [2026-06-18] Single static crop offset per segment (no dynamic tracking)

**Context:** Alternative was to track the face frame-by-frame.

**Decision:** One average offset computed from samples every 2 seconds.

**Rationale:** Dynamic tracking produces visible shakiness. A static offset is visually stable for talking-head videos where the speaker doesn't move much.

## [2026-06-18] uv instead of pip/virtualenv

**Context:** Dependency management for isolated per-project venv.

**Decision:** `uv` for all package management operations.

**Rationale:** 10–100x faster than pip. Torch + whisperx install significantly faster.

## [2026-06-19] Trim at sentence boundary for SRT entries spanning segment end

**Context:** SRT entries covering the segment end-time included text not spoken in the clip.

**Options:**
- A) Proportional trim (word count ≈ time fraction)
- B) Trim at last sentence-ending punctuation before the proportional estimate

**Decision:** B — sentence boundary.

**Rationale:** Option A left the first word of the next sentence (e.g. "Iar"). Option B cuts cleanly at "cod." and includes no out-of-clip text.
