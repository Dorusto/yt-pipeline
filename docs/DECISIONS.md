## [2026-06-18] WhisperX forced alignment instead of re-running Whisper

**Context:** `shorts_generator.py` was running Whisper a second time on the audio segment for word timestamps, independently of the first SRT-generating run.

**Options:**
- A) Save `_words.json` on the first Whisper run (simple, but text may contain transcription errors)
- B) WhisperX forced alignment on corrected SRT (correct text, separate run)

**Decision:** B — WhisperX forced alignment.

**Rationale:** The corrected SRT is the single source of truth. WhisperX aligns the correct text to audio precisely, eliminating transcription errors from karaoke highlights. One place to fix mistakes.

## [2026-06-18] OpenCV Haar cascades instead of MediaPipe for face detection

**Context:** MediaPipe 0.10 removed the `mp.solutions` API. Required a model download and new API.

**Options:**
- A) Downgrade MediaPipe to 0.9.x
- B) MediaPipe Tasks API (new) + model download
- C) OpenCV Haar cascades (built-in, no extra dependencies)

**Decision:** C — OpenCV Haar cascades.

**Rationale:** Zero overhead, already installed. Since we use one static offset per segment (not dynamic tracking), a more sophisticated model's accuracy gain doesn't justify the added complexity.

---

## [2026-06-18] Single static crop offset per segment (no dynamic tracking)

**Context:** Alternative was to track the face frame-by-frame.

**Decision:** One average offset computed from samples every 2 seconds.

**Rationale:** Dynamic tracking produces visible shakiness. A static offset is visually stable for talking-head videos where the speaker doesn't move much.

---

## [2026-06-18] uv instead of pip/virtualenv

**Context:** Dependency management for isolated per-project venv.

**Decision:** `uv` for all package management operations.

**Rationale:** 10–100x faster than pip. Torch + whisperx install significantly faster.

---

## [2026-06-19] Trim at sentence boundary for SRT entries spanning segment boundaries

**Context:** SRT entries covering the segment start or end time included text not spoken in the clip. WhisperX aligned all text in the entry, producing words outside the clip bounds in the karaoke output.

**Options:**
- A) Proportional trim (word count ≈ time fraction)
- B) Trim at nearest sentence-ending punctuation relative to the proportional estimate

**Decision:** B — sentence boundary, applied at both start and end.

**Rationale:** Option A left partial sentences (e.g. "Iar" at the end, or "Dacă eu pot..." at the start). Option B cuts cleanly at natural sentence breaks. Applied symmetrically: end-straddle trims backward to last punctuation before cut; start-straddle trims forward to first punctuation after cut.

## [2026-06-19] Manual `x_offset` override per segment

**Context:** Face detection via Haar cascades works on frontal faces but the auto-detected offset may not match the desired framing for every segment.

**Decision:** Add optional `x_offset` key per segment in `shorts_config.yaml`. If present, skip face detection entirely for that segment.

**Rationale:** Gives the creator precise control without disabling auto-detection globally. Segments without `x_offset` still auto-detect.

## [2026-08-16] Hand-generate MLT/Kdenlive XML instead of pre-cutting clips with ffmpeg

**Context:** an earlier attempt (before this repo existed) pre-cut every selected moment into separate small files with ffmpeg and imported them into Kdenlive — the resulting project had hundreds of tiny clips and Kdenlive couldn't process the timeline (crashed / hung).

**Options:**
- A) Pre-cut every fragment to its own file with ffmpeg, import into Kdenlive
- B) Generate a `.kdenlive` project file directly (MLT XML) referencing the original source files with in/out points per fragment — no re-encoding, no extra files

**Decision:** B.

**Rationale:** Kdenlive/MLT natively supports multiple timeline entries against one source producer with different in/out — there was never a need to physically cut files. This also keeps fragment count low (dozens, not hundreds) since fragments are curated quote-level cuts, not every micro-pause. Validated with `melt -consumer xml project.kdenlive` before ever opening in the GUI, to catch XML errors cheaply.

## [2026-08-16] Video and audio must be on separate tracks, not one combined AV track

**Context:** first version put each fragment as a single `<entry>` on one V1 track, referencing an `avformat` chain that contains both video and audio streams. `melt` rendered this correctly with audio (verified: `melt project.kdenlive -consumer avformat:test.mp4` produced a file with an audio stream). Opened in Kdenlive: video played, but no sound.

**Root cause:** Kdenlive's UI strictly separates track *types* — a track shown as "video" (V1/V2) never routes audio to the mixer/monitor in the app, regardless of what the underlying MLT producer contains. This only affects Kdenlive's own playback/mixer; `melt`'s own render path plays/encodes audio from a combined producer just fine. Confirmed by inspecting a real hand-edited `.kdenlive` project: every clip with audio has a *separate* audio-track entry, even when the video-track entry references the exact same source file.

**Decision:** every fragment gets two entries — one on a video-only track (`hide="audio"` on the `<track>`) and one on an audio-only track (`hide="video"`), both referencing the same `<chain>` producer with different `hide` masks.

**Rationale:** this is not a workaround, it is how Kdenlive's UI model actually works — confirmed against a real project, not guessed. `melt`-level validation does not catch this class of bug (it validates MLT semantics, not Kdenlive UI behavior), so this required an actual open-in-Kdenlive test to discover.

## [2026-08-16] Explicit `video_index`/`audio_index` on chain producers

**Context:** DJI Action 4 `.MP4` files contain more than one video+audio pair — `ffprobe` shows stream 0 (h264, video), stream 1 (aac, audio), several `data` streams (GPS/telemetry), and a second video stream (mjpeg, likely an embedded thumbnail). Without explicit stream selection, first attempts produced no audio in the Kdenlive project bin thumbnail/preview.

**Decision:** always set `video_index="0"` and `audio_index="1"` explicitly on every `<chain>`, after confirming via `ffprobe -show_entries stream=index,codec_type` that this mapping is consistent across all source files in a shoot (checked 4 different files from different days before trusting it).

**Rationale:** relying on MLT's automatic stream selection is not safe for action-cam footage with extra metadata streams. Cheap to verify with `ffprobe` per-source before generating.

---

## [2026-08-16] `kdenlive:docproperties.version` is a required property, not optional metadata

**Context:** the first generated `.kdenlive` opened with an "Incorrect project file — Version of the project file cannot be read" dialog (non-fatal, Kdenlive opened it anyway, but it's a bad first impression / signals an incomplete file).

**Decision:** always set `<property name="kdenlive:docproperties.version">1.1</property>` (and `kdenlive:docproperties.kdenliveversion`, `kdenlive:documentnotesversion`) inside the `main_bin` playlist. Found by inspecting a real project file — this property is unrelated to the MLT framework's own `version="7.40.0"` attribute on the root `<mlt>` element, which is not what Kdenlive checks.

---

## [2026-08-16] Track order in `<tractor>` is the reverse of the on-screen order

**Context:** first version listed the video track before the audio track in the `<tractor>`'s `<track>` list; Kdenlive displayed audio *above* video (opposite of the intended V1-on-top-of-A1 layout).

**Decision:** the *last* `<track>` element in the tractor is the *topmost* track in Kdenlive's UI. Order used: A2, A1, V1, V2 (bottom to top in XML = bottom to top in UI, i.e. V2 last/topmost). Confirmed empirically (swap the order, re-test) and cross-checked against a real project's track ordering (audio tracks listed before video tracks in its main sequence tractor).

## [2026-08-16] Subtitle retiming as a plain `.srt` + native Kdenlive import, not hand-generated subtitle XML

**Context:** needed captions on the rough-cut timeline reflecting what's actually said (not just a debug label). Kdenlive has a native "Subtitles" track feature with its own internal representation.

**Options:**
- A) Reverse-engineer Kdenlive's native subtitle XML/JSON structure and inject it directly into the generated project
- B) Generate a plain, retimed `.srt` file as a separate output, imported manually via `Project → Subtitles → Import Subtitle File`

**Decision:** B.

**Rationale:** the video/audio track split above already required one real Kdenlive-open-and-check cycle to get right, purely from undocumented UI behavior; the native subtitle structure is a similar unknown. `srt_from_fragments.py` reuses the exact manual import step already established in this project's normal S6 workflow (see root `CLAUDE.md` → "Pasul 5 — Import în KDenLive"), so there's no new failure surface, no new Kdenlive-internals reverse-engineering, and it's immediately usable.

---

## [2026-08-16] Declined: automatic video+audio clip grouping

**Context:** with video/audio split onto separate tracks, dragging or trimming one fragment doesn't move its audio counterpart along with it (no visible link between the pair) — user asked whether this can be automated ("if it's not much work").

**Investigation:** Kdenlive stores clip groups as `kdenlive:sequenceproperties.groups`, a JSON tree (`{"children": [{"data": "trackIndex:framePosition:-1", "leaf": "clip", "type": "Leaf"}, ...], "type": "AVSplit"}`) attached to the *sequence*-level producer (a further layer of nesting not otherwise needed by this generator). The `trackIndex`/`framePosition` encoding is undocumented and wasn't reverse-engineered with confidence.

**Decision:** not implemented. Grouping stays a manual step in Kdenlive (select both clips, `Ctrl+G`).

**Rationale:** unlike the video/audio split (confirmed necessary — no sound without it) or the version property (confirmed necessary — warning dialog without it), this is a convenience feature, not a correctness fix. `melt` validation cannot check whether a hand-written groups JSON is well-formed for Kdenlive's purposes (groups aren't part of MLT playback) — every attempt would need a real open-and-drag test in the GUI, same slow feedback loop as the audio bug, for a problem the user already has a trivial two-click manual fix for.

## [2026-06-19] Per-short metadata via `--shorts-config` in `analyze_srt.py`

**Context:** `analyze_srt.py` only generated metadata for the main video. Shorts need their own title, description, tags, and hashtags for upload.

**Options:**
- A) Separate script for per-short metadata
- B) `--shorts-config` flag on existing `analyze_srt.py`

**Decision:** B — extend `analyze_srt.py`.

**Rationale:** Reuses the existing DeepSeek client and SRT parsing. One script to call, one place to maintain. Output goes in `shorts/{name}_metadata.txt` next to each video file.
