# RELEASES — released versions and what is stable

One section per version. Per version: the tools and behaviour marked **stable** (passed the real test, has a regression test) and **experimental** (everything else). The protocol is in [`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md).

## v0.1.0 (candidate, not released)

**Candidate until the owner confirms the real test.** Nothing here is tagged yet.

**Stable candidate** — the holiday flow in the web app:

- Upload with progress (drag and drop several clips, per-file progress).
- The recap run from the web app.
- The run notice with step times and model cost.
- Versions (each run keeps its edit and renders under `versions/vNNN/`).
- The shaky review policy.

**Experimental** — everything else:

- The publish kit.
- Metadata.
- Thumbnail.
- Shorts.
- The audit changes.
- Costs ledger.
- The Costs page and the feedback/requests form.
- Title, description and hashtags for a recap.
- Pilot host install, update and rollback (`deploy/update.sh`, `deploy/yt-pipeline-web.service`, `docs/guides/pilot-host.md`).

**Stable files** — the files behind the stable candidate above. A change to one
needs the `Stable-change: approved` trailer on a commit in the range (see
[`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md)); the check is `scripts/check_stable.py`:

```stable-files
scripts/serve.py
scripts/recap.py
scripts/common/versions.py
scripts/quality.py
```
